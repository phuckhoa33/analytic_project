    <p>
        Resetting your password is a crucial step in securing your account. We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of the harmful effects of unauthorized access and the potential risks associated with compromised passwords:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Unauthorized access to your account can lead to a data breach, exposing your personal and sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> Compromised passwords are often used in identity theft, posing significant risks to your online presence and reputation.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Implications:</strong> In some cases, unauthorized access can lead to financial losses if your account is linked to payment methods.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Recommendations for Password Security:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Passwords:</strong> Create a strong and unique password using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Change Password Regularly:</strong> Periodically change your password to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Activate 2FA for an additional layer of security. This requires a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your mobile device.</li>
